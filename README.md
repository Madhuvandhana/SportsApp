`Monetization Strategies for the app`

 Used the following strategies to monetize the app,

`1. In-App purchases`
        Increase the app revenue, the notification is sent which prompts the user for in-app purchase.
        Implemented notification using Firebase.

        PS: Not tested the functionality as I had to upload the app on playstore

`2.  In-App Advertising`
         Admob Setup using Firebase SDK for google analytics that logs custom events and other metrics. Also by combining other useful feature of firebase into Admob.
         The app demonstrate two types of Ads
         
             1) Rewarded Video Ads - Keeps the user engaged and ways to facilitate cross-promote which results in more number of downloads
             2) Banner Ads - Non disruptive ad banners
